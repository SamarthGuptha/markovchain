This is a Python based simulation that visualizes the evolution of fractal trees. Unlike standard recursive drawing, this engine uses Linear Algebra (Rotation Matrices) to calculate vector growth, allowing for organic, mathematically complex structures that evolve over time to maximize their reach.   

 ##NOTE:- STARTED BUILDING IN MANIM(Master branch), then switched to pygame in turtle branch.
